# ADR-005: Operational Concerns and Monitoring

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The ingestion system needs robust operational capabilities to handle production workloads reliably. This includes monitoring, error recovery, testing strategies, and security considerations for handling API keys and external data sources.

## Questions to Address

### 1. Monitoring and Observability
**Question**: How do we monitor ingestion progress and failures?

**Monitoring Dimensions**:
- **Throughput Metrics**: Documents ingested per hour/day, processing rates
- **Quality Metrics**: Success rates, validation failures, data quality scores
- **Cost Tracking**: LLM API costs, processing expenses, budget utilization
- **Latency Metrics**: Time from source to enhanced storage, processing delays
- **Error Patterns**: Failure rates by source, document type, processing stage

**Observability Requirements**:
- **Real-time Dashboards**: Live view of ingestion pipeline health
- **Alerting System**: Proactive notifications for failures and budget limits
- **Audit Trails**: Complete logging of all ingestion decisions and transformations
- **Performance Analytics**: Trend analysis and capacity planning data

**Monitoring Stack Options**:
- **Prometheus + Grafana**: Metrics collection and visualization
- **ELK Stack**: Log aggregation and analysis
- **Custom Dashboard**: Integration with existing API health monitoring
- **Cloud Monitoring**: AWS CloudWatch, Google Cloud Monitoring

### 2. Error Recovery and Resilience
**Question**: What's our retry and error recovery strategy?

**Failure Categories**:
- **Transient Failures**: Network timeouts, API rate limits, temporary service outages
- **Data Quality Failures**: Malformed documents, validation errors, parsing failures
- **Processing Failures**: LLM API errors, cost budget exhaustion, enhancement failures
- **System Failures**: Database connectivity, service crashes, dependency failures

**Recovery Strategies**:
- **Exponential Backoff**: Progressive retry delays for transient failures
- **Circuit Breakers**: Automatic fallback when external services are consistently failing
- **Dead Letter Queues**: Parking failed jobs for manual review and reprocessing
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue basic ingestion when enhancement services fail

**Resilience Patterns**:
- **Idempotent Operations**: Safe to retry any processing step
- **Checkpointing**: Resume processing from last successful point
- **Compensation Actions**: Rollback capabilities for partial failures
- **Health Checks**: Proactive monitoring of all system dependencies

### 3. Testing Strategy
**Question**: How do we test this without constantly hitting real APIs?

**Testing Challenges**:
- **API Rate Limits**: Avoiding exhaustion of real API quotas during testing
- **Data Consistency**: Ensuring tests don't pollute production databases
- **Cost Control**: Preventing test runs from incurring LLM processing costs
- **Realistic Scenarios**: Testing with representative legal document data

**Testing Approaches**:
- **Mock Services**: HTTP mocking for CourtListener and other APIs
- **Test Data Sets**: Curated legal documents for consistent testing
- **Sandbox Environments**: Isolated test infrastructure with test databases
- **Contract Testing**: Verify API integrations without full end-to-end calls

**Testing Levels**:
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing with mocked dependencies
- **Integration Tests**: Service interaction testing with test databases
- **End-to-End Tests**: Full pipeline testing with mocked external APIs
- **Load Tests**: Performance testing with synthetic document workloads

### 4. Security and API Management
**Question**: How do we handle API key management and rotation?

**Security Concerns**:
- **API Key Storage**: Secure storage and access to external service credentials
- **Key Rotation**: Regular rotation of API keys without service disruption
- **Access Controls**: Limiting which services can access external APIs
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail of all external API interactions

**API Management Requirements**:
- **Rate Limit Coordination**: Respect external API limits across multiple instances
- **Usage Tracking**: Monitor API usage against quotas and billing limits
- **Failover Strategies**: Backup API keys or alternative data sources
- **Security Monitoring**: Detection of unusual API usage patterns

**Key Management Options**:
- **Environment Variables**: Simple approach for development
- **HashiCorp Vault**: Enterprise secret management
- **Cloud Key Management**: AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secret Manager
- **Kubernetes Secrets**: Container-native secret management

## Decision Points Needed

### Monitoring Architecture
1. **Metrics Collection**: How to instrument ingestion pipeline for observability
2. **Alerting Strategy**: What constitutes actionable alerts vs informational metrics
3. **Dashboard Design**: Key metrics for different stakeholders (ops, legal, business)
4. **Log Management**: Structured logging strategy for debugging and compliance

### Error Handling Framework
1. **Retry Policies**: Specific retry strategies for different failure types
2. **Escalation Procedures**: When to involve human operators vs automatic recovery
3. **Data Recovery**: How to handle corrupted or lost ingestion data
4. **Service Dependencies**: Managing cascading failures across services

### Operational Workflows
1. **Deployment Strategy**: Blue-green deployments, rolling updates, rollback procedures
2. **Capacity Planning**: Scaling strategies for varying ingestion workloads
3. **Maintenance Windows**: Scheduled maintenance with minimal service disruption
4. **Incident Response**: Runbooks for common operational issues

## Operational Playbooks

### Common Incident Scenarios
1. **CourtListener API Down**: Fallback procedures and user communication
2. **LLM Budget Exhausted**: Degraded service mode and budget reset procedures
3. **Database Storage Full**: Emergency cleanup and capacity expansion
4. **High Error Rates**: Diagnosis and remediation workflows

### Monitoring Alerts
```yaml
# Example Alert Configurations
alerts:
  - name: "High Ingestion Failure Rate"
    condition: "failure_rate > 10% for 5 minutes"
    severity: "warning"
    action: "notify ops team"
  
  - name: "LLM Budget Near Limit"
    condition: "budget_utilization > 85%"
    severity: "warning"
    action: "notify stakeholders"
  
  - name: "Ingestion Pipeline Stopped"
    condition: "no documents processed for 30 minutes"
    severity: "critical"
    action: "page on-call engineer"
```

### Performance Baselines
- **Ingestion Rate**: Target 1000 documents/hour during normal operations
- **Processing Latency**: 95th percentile < 5 minutes from source to enhanced storage
- **Error Rate**: < 5% overall failure rate across all processing stages
- **Cost Efficiency**: < $0.10 per document for complete processing pipeline
