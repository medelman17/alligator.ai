# Memory Architecture for alligator.ai

## Overview

Memory capabilities will enable alligator.ai's AI agents to maintain context across research sessions, learn from past investigations, and provide increasingly personalized and effective legal research support.

## Memory Types

### 1. Working Memory (Session-Based)
**Purpose**: Maintain context during active research sessions
**Duration**: Current session only
**Storage**: Redis with TTL (Time-To-Live)

**Components**:
- Current research objective and constraints
- Recently retrieved cases and their relevance scores
- Active legal theories being explored
- Preliminary findings and hypotheses
- User feedback and refinements during session

**Implementation**:
```python
class WorkingMemory:
    - session_id: str
    - research_context: Dict[str, Any]
    - case_analysis_cache: Dict[str, CaseAnalysis]
    - hypothesis_stack: List[LegalHypothesis]
    - user_preferences: SessionPreferences
```

### 2. Episodic Memory (Research History)
**Purpose**: Learn from past research projects and outcomes
**Duration**: Permanent
**Storage**: PostgreSQL with vector embeddings in ChromaDB

**Components**:
- Complete research project histories
- Successful argument patterns and strategies
- Failed approaches and dead ends
- Case outcome correlations
- Time-to-resolution metrics

**Use Cases**:
- "We researched similar employment discrimination cases 3 months ago"
- "This argument pattern was successful before Judge Smith"
- "Avoid this precedent chain - it led to summary judgment"

### 3. Semantic Memory (Legal Knowledge Graph)
**Purpose**: Build evolving understanding of legal concepts and relationships
**Duration**: Permanent with versioning
**Storage**: Neo4j graph + ChromaDB embeddings

**Components**:
- Legal concept relationships and evolution
- Doctrine interaction patterns
- Jurisdiction-specific interpretations
- Temporal changes in legal landscape
- Cross-practice area connections

**Features**:
- Automated extraction from analyzed cases
- Crowdsourced corrections from attorney feedback
- Version control for tracking doctrinal evolution
- Confidence scoring based on citation frequency

### 4. Personalization Memory (User/Firm Profiles)
**Purpose**: Adapt to specific attorney and firm preferences
**Duration**: Permanent
**Storage**: PostgreSQL with encrypted PII

**Components**:
- Attorney writing style patterns
- Preferred argument structures
- Firm-specific terminology and conventions
- Client industry considerations
- Jurisdiction preferences
- Success rate by strategy type

## Memory Integration Architecture

### 1. Memory Router
Central service that determines which memories to access based on agent type and task:

```python
class MemoryRouter:
    def get_relevant_memories(
        self,
        agent_type: AgentType,
        task_context: TaskContext,
        user_id: str,
        firm_id: str
    ) -> RelevantMemories:
        # Returns filtered, ranked memories from all sources
```

### 2. Memory Scoring & Relevance

**Relevance Factors**:
- Temporal decay (recent memories weighted higher)
- Similarity score (vector distance)
- Success correlation (outcome-based weighting)
- User-specific relevance (personalization)
- Jurisdiction matching
- Practice area alignment

**Scoring Algorithm**:
```python
relevance_score = (
    0.3 * semantic_similarity +
    0.2 * temporal_relevance +
    0.2 * success_correlation +
    0.15 * user_relevance +
    0.15 * jurisdiction_match
)
```

### 3. Memory Retrieval Strategies

**Hybrid Retrieval**:
1. Vector similarity search in ChromaDB
2. Graph traversal in Neo4j for related concepts
3. SQL queries for structured filters
4. Redis lookup for active session context

**Retrieval Pipeline**:
```python
async def retrieve_memories(query: MemoryQuery) -> List[Memory]:
    # Parallel retrieval from multiple sources
    results = await asyncio.gather(
        vector_search(query),
        graph_search(query),
        structured_search(query),
        session_search(query)
    )
    return rank_and_merge(results)
```

## Agent-Specific Memory Needs

## Memory Lifecycle Management

### 1. Memory Creation
